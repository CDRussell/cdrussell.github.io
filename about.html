<p>The best way to get in touch is via Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/trionkidnapper">@trionkidnapper</a>. I‚Äôm always happy for folks to reach out and say hi.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm big believer in sharing knowledge, and I like what blogging brings to the table.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I like to blog because life is too short for everyone to solve the same problems over and over.</li>
  <li>I like to blog because it forces me to learn what I don‚Äôt know about something, something I maybe thought I fully understood initially.</li>

<h1 id="core-skills">Core Skills:</h1>

<h2 id="android-developer">Android Developer</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm an Android developer at my core, with a passion for Kotlin, Architecture Components and writing good unit tests. I‚Äôve been a professional Android developer since 2010.</p>

<h2 id="coaching--mentoring">Coaching / Mentoring</h2>
<p>As well as software development, I‚Äôve always found deep satisfaction in coaching and mentoring others. Although related, understanding that coaching and mentoring are two distinct tools, and knowing when each should be used, is key to unblocking and supporting others. I have endless energy for this.</p>
